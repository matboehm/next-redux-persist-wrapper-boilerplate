# Next.js Redux Persist Boilerplate

A ready-to-use boilerplate project that demonstrates how to use Next.js 13 with redux, redux-persist and next-redux-wrapper.

## Introduction

When looking for a solution to persist a redux store with the latest Next.js version 13, I was unable to find an out-of-the-box solution. There were always pitfalls here and there and after lengthy Google and StackOverflow research, I decided to publish my solution on GitHub for everyone to copy and use.

Inspired by the repository [with-next-redux-wrapper-redux-persist](https://github.com/fazlulkarimweb/with-next-redux-wrapper-redux-persist/tree/master).

## Features

- Latest Next.js version 13
- Redux for state management with redux toolkit (as recommended by the redux creators)
- Redux Persist for persistent state storage
- Next Redux wrapper to connect Redux and Next.js
- Basic ToDo app as an example
